## 📊 Full Practice Test Suite Plan

### Tests 02-10: Topic Emphasis

| Test | Primary Focus | Secondary Focus | Difficulty |
|------|---------------|-----------------|------------|
| **Test 02** | Compute Engine, Cloud Storage | Networking | Balanced |
| **Test 03** | Networking, VPC | Security, Firewalls | Balanced |
| **Test 04** | GKE, Containers | Cloud Run, Serverless | Medium-Hard |
| **Test 05** | Cloud SQL, BigQuery | Data services | Balanced |
| **Test 06** | Cloud Operations | Monitoring, Logging, SLOs | Medium-Hard |
| **Test 07** | Mixed (Complex scenarios) | All topics | Hard |
| **Test 08** | IAM, Security | Encryption, Compliance | Balanced |
| **Test 09** | Serverless, Hybrid | Functions, Pub/Sub, VPN | Medium-Hard |
| **Test 10** | Comprehensive Review | All topics equally | Hard |

## 🎯 How to Generate Remaining Tests

### Option 1: Use Existing Practice Questions

1. Mix and match these questions into tests
2. Create variations of existing questions
3. Draw from the comprehensive explanations in each topic file

### Option 2: Template for Creating Tests

Each test should follow this structure:

```markdown
